  The aim of this project is to provide a PC Benchmarking Program for measuring the performance of different processors, 
such as their frequency, memory size, transfer speed of a block of data and execution time of arithmetic and logical operations.  

  The main purpose of the project is understanding and comparing the capabilities of various systems: 
a PC benchmarking program offers a clear, quantitative way to assess, compare, and understand processor capabilities. 
These insights are valuable for hardware selection, system optimization, overclocking and real-world task evaluation.
